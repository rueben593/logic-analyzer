# Project 1 : “Logic Analyzer + Minimal Oscilloscope + Signal Generator” 

# 1.ABSTRACT
The aim of the project  is to design and construct a prototype with the functionality of a minimal oscilloscope, function generator with signal square, traingle and sin signal as output and also consist of a logic analyser. This  prototype was constructed on a breadboard using a Teensy 3.2 development board and operated by a button, potentiometer, and PC USB to UART communication. The system's display made use of an SSD1306 OLED screen and UART to PC USB, visualised on a program called SerialPlot.This 
prototype not included the logic analyser function.
